## 1 Introduction

### 1.1 What is TutAssistor?
Welcome to the user guide of TutAssistor!

Are you a private tutor struggling to keep track of all your classes and students? Do you spend 
countless hours on administrative duties such as scheduling classes and updating numerous students' records?

If the above situation sounds familiar to you, fret not, **TutAssistor** is here to save the day!

**TutAssistor** is a ***desktop app intended for private tutors like yourself to 
manage their students and classes, and it is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)***.

**TutAssistor** uses Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you operate the application by typing commands into a Command Box. 
If you are a fast typer, you can operate the application more easily and faster than
Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact 
with the application via graphical icons such as buttons.

You do not have to worry at all even if you are new to CLI applications as 
this user guide will take you through step by step on how various 
features of the **TutAssistor** can be utilised, all directed towards 
providing the best possible experience to the user.

### 1.2 What can TutAssistor do for you?

TutAssistor provides an all-in-one platform for you to manage information 
regarding your students and lessons stress-free and efficiently. In the latest version, we offer you the ability to: 

* Track student details
* Keep student details up-to-date
* Resolve conflicting tuition timeslots
* Efficiently create notes for each class/student

### 1.3 How to use this guide?

#### Step-by-step guide for each feature

The features in this guide are formatted with the following conventions:

* **Command Keyword** - Each feature is executed by a command keyword. The shortcut for each command is shown together with its full command keyword separated by the <code>&#124;</code> symbol. You can use the command shortcuts to reduce typing. 
* **Command Format** - Each command is accompanied by a set of information that you provide. Refer to the [Features](#3-features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3 Features
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [r/REMARK]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/student` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used zero or more times.<br>
  e.g. `si/STUDENT_INDEX [STUDENT_INDEX]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `si/1`, `si/1 2 3` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
   
Refer to the [Additional Command Format Information](#4-additional-command-format-information) under section 4 to learn the requirements of the various parameters used.

## 5 FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TutAssistor home folder.<br>

**Q**: Do I lose all the details of classes and students when I close the application?<br>
**A**: All of your data is stored locally in a file under the data folder and will be loaded upon the next entry,
hence you do not lose any data.<br>

**Q**: What should I do if I am unsure of the command formats?<br>
**A**: Please type `help` to learn the command formats.<br>
